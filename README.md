# skin-cancer-123
This project focuses on skin cancer detection using deep learning techniques, aiming to classify dermoscopic images of skin lesions as benign or malignant. The system leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, such as ResNet50, MobileNetV2, or DenseNet121, trained on publicly available datasets like HAM10000 or ISIC-2024
